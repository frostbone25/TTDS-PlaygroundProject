Connected Content Manager
ConnectedContentManager.lua
ServerTech
Hub for centralized back end server communication. Typically called at title screen to minimize network traffic.
Require Silo\'s you want this to manage, like PatchManager, PlatformConnect, or TelltaleConnect
Each of these can be disabled with overrides:
bool ConnectedContentManager_IsTTServerUpdateSupported()
bool ConnectedContentManager_IsPlatformServerUpdateSupported()
bool ConnectedContentManager_IsPatcheServerUpdateSupported()
Additionally, you can override these to get a call before and after each update for messaging.  You must return from these! 
nil ConnectedContentManager_ShowUpdatingPatchServerMessage()
nil ConnectedContentManager_HideUpdatingPatchServerMessage()
nil ConnectedContentManager_ShowUpdatingTelltaleServerMessage()
nil ConnectedContentManager_HideUpdatingTelltaleServerMessage()
nil ConnectedContentManager_ShowUpdatingPlatformServerMessage()
nil ConnectedContentManager_HideUpdatingPlatformServerMessage()
nil ConnectedContentManager_Update()
Blocking call which updates the all available back-end server data
It essentially calls all the rest of the updates in this system and then updates DLC status
nil ConnectedContentManager_UpdateDLC()
Performs whatever server update calls are necessary to update data used by the DLC system.
DLC status is then updated as well.
The calls made here are always a subset of the normal update calls.
bool,string ConnectedContentManager_UpdatePlatformServer()
Updates platform backend data
On Success, returns true. On failure returns nil and an error message
bool,string ConnectedContentManager_UpdateTTServer()
Updates data from the Telltale server
bool,string ConnectedContentManager_UpdatePatchServer()
Output is entirely dependent on the enabled systems, see them for details

Cross-title Save Manager
CrossTitleSaveManager.lua
Mounts user space directories from old projects and allows reading files out of them.
(cross_title_saves.prop)
For each different title\'s content that can be mounted (identified by an id), specifies a number of parameters that describe how to mount that title\'s content.
This can be very technical and in many cases will have to be managed by someone from the core team.
New entries can be added with CrossTitleSaveManager_AddTitle.
nil CrossTitleSaveManager_AddTitle( id )
Tool only. Adds a new cross title location to the property file that will be referred to by the given id.
boolean,string CrossTitleSaveManager_Open( id )
Attempts to mount the space identified by the given id. If the space is already mounted, it returns true without doing anything.
Otherwise, it returns true on success and false on failure.
On failure, there is a second return value which is a string indicating the kind of error. Possibilities include:
This operation may cause the thread to sleep while the operation processes in the background.
Handle CrossTitleSaveManager_GetFile( id, filename )
Returns a handle to the file with the given name in the given userspace.
Make sure the space has successfully been opened with CrossTitleSaveManager_Open before attempting to call this function.
If the file cannot be opened for some reason, this will return false instead of a handle.
A property set returned through this API will have its globals removed.

DLC Status
DLCStatus.lua
Updates the status of any DLC in terms of purchased, installed, available to purchase, etc . . . from backend/local data
(connectedcontent.prop)
\'DLC Names\' should have the DLC refrence names listed.  This file will then generate placeholders for the DLC
(project_connectedcontent.prop)
The \'DLC\' key is a map that uses the \'DLC Name\' to access it.  It will contain props which describe all episode data
Overide this to manually force status of DLC
nil DLCStatus_RefreshCustom(dlcProp)
nil DLCStatus_Refresh()
This will update \'Installed\', \'Available\' and \'Purchased\' status of DLC. It should be called after changes to state
This can be called as often as needed
This is the output data for the system and will be set initially but updated
if there is every a succesfull call to DLCStatus_Refresh. 
All this data is available via episode properties inside the pref \'DLC\':
\'Available\' - The game can is available to be purchased or played. 
\'Purchased\' - The game has been bought by the user or their ownership is implicit(like Ep in non demo cases)
\'Installed\' - The game is physically available to be played
\'Downloaded\' - The game was downloaded or installed separate than the base game

DownloadManager.lua
This is responsible for acquiring episodes to disk and installing them
The \'DLC\' key is a map that uses the \'DLC Name\' to access it.  DLC being downloaded should be \'purchased\', this can 
be done with the PurchaseManager or setting the keys manually
Overide these in order to show, get updates for, and hide the message while download.  Must return from these!
nil DownloadManager_ShowDownloadingMessage()
nil DownloadManager_UpdateDownloadingMessage(percent, downloaded, total)
nil DownloadManager_HideDownloadingMessage()
bool,string DownloadManager_Download(dlc, progressFunction)
This will download the DLC identified by the DLC argument (as specified in connectedcontent.prop).
Note that successful and unsuccessful downloads can both take a long time to process. This function 
will not return until the download is finished one way or the other, but other Lua threads will continue 
to run in the meantime. Once a download is started, no other Download Manager API function can be called until 
it finishes with the sole exception of DownloadManager_Cancel. While a download is in progress, the game 
should not initiate a scene transition.
Before the download starts, the DownloadManager_ShowDownloadingMessage override will be called. After the download 
finishes, the DownloadManager_HideDownloadingMessage override will be called. If the show call is made, the hide call 
will always be made. However, if failure happens early on, it is possible that neither will be called.
In between show and hide, the progress callback will usually be called periodically. If a progressFunction is not passed in, the 
DownloadManager_UpdateDownloadingMessage callback will be used by default. The progress function will receive three arguments: 
first a floating point percentage between 0 and 100, then the number of bytes that has been download, and then the total number 
of bytes that will be downloaded. Because it is floating point, it is recommended that the percentage is truncated to a fixed number 
of decimal points before displaying it to the user.
In the case that is Purchase Manager silo is enabled and PurchaseManager_PurchaseIncludesDownload is true, this function will redirect 
to PurchaseManager_Purchase.
On Success, returns true. On failure returns false and an error code as the second return value.
Known error messages are as follows:
: The device is reporting that it is not connected to the internet.
: The User Manager silo is reporting that the user is not licensed.
: The User Manager silo is reporting that the user is not logged in.
: The current platform does not support cloud sync. (This should never occur in the current version.)
: The given DLC name is not found in prefs[\
]; DLC may not be set up correctly for this project.
: The \
 key for the given DLC name is missing or empty.
: The given DLC has not been purchased.
: The given DLC is already installed.
: To get the DLC the game must first be updated. (It may be that the update includes the DLC or that the update is needed before downloading the DLC in-game.)
Additionally, generic network error messages may be returned. Known messages are as follows:
: The host is returning a \'404\' to the resquest indicating that the requested resource is not available. (Previously, this was also called \
.)
: The host could not be resolved. This could indicate a DNS problem. (CURLE_COULDNT_RESOLVE_HOST)
: Connection to the host failed. (CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT)
: There was a problem trying to save a downloaded file to disk. The user may be low on space. (CURLE_WRITE_ERROR)
: Timed out connecting or waiting for response from server. (CURLE_OPERATION_TIMEDOUT)
: The operation was canceled by the user. (CURLE_ABORTED_BY_CALLBACK)
: A problem occurred with the request, but it is not a common error, and no more information is available. If this occurs, contact the core engineering team and they will provide a better error code string.
nil DownloadManager_Cancel(dlc)
Cancel the currently active download. For forwards-compatibility, it is requested that users pass in the id of the currently active 
download. If the download is far enough along, it is possible that the download will still succeed even 
if the cancel call was made. It is also possible that the download will fail for a different reason than cancellation even if canel 
is called.
int,string DownloadManager_LocalSize(dlc)
This will return the size in bytes of the locally downloaded content associated with the given dlc. This includes data associated with in-progress downloads.
In the case of a setup problem, it may return false with an error code.
bool,string DownloadManager_Remove(dlc)
This will remove from the dlc indicated by name
bool DownloadManager_NeedToReset()
Determine if there is unmounted downloads that we need to reset for
\'Installed\' - Actually installed and can be played
\'Downloaded\' - If the game was downloaded, rather than pre-installed.

Patches existing episodes with SynchFS data.
This must be initialized to the project defaults for series name, number of episodes, series
These values should be set offline for the entire series and saves in the props
The values for \'Installed\' and \'downloaded\' should be set as appropriate, so the game knows what to update
For offline builds, this coudl be done manually. For connected builds, use EpisodeStatus silo
Overide this in order to have behavior around having an update for the code running.  For main game update, dlcName will be nil
nil  PatchManager_DLCUpdateTrigger(dlcName)()
nil PatchManager_Update(disableAutoLoad)
Updates all required patches over the net if supported. 
Optional parameter to indicate if we supress auto loading of patches. If not set or false, this 
calls PatchManager_SetEpisodePatchToLoadOnBoot when new data comes in.  If true, this is stopped. 
The callback overide PatchManager_DLCUpdateTrigger is called if the current episode has updates. 
This is done so that the game can offer an update to the user or reload automatically 
nil PatchManager_SetEpisodePatchToLoadOnBoot(episode)
This will set a pref that indicates that on reboot, project switch, or any reload that 
this patch will be loaded on top of the gamedata. 
bool PatchManager_NeedToReset()
Determine if there are updated patches that we have to reset in order to mount
PatchManager_DLCUpdateTrigger()
The only output would be that an dlc has an update
Otherwise, the data is just updated and will load automatically next time episode is launched as needed
dlc
 has new data, we should offer/trigger a reset perhaps
Main game updated, we should offcer/trigger a reset

Previous Season Saves
PreviousSeasonSaves.lua
Download and work with saves from previous seasons of different games (made for WD4)
nil PreviousSeasonSaves_Cancel()
Cancel the current download process, this will cancel all the downloads.
bool PreviousSeasonSaves_CheckConfiguratorAvailable(currentSeasonName, completeCallback)
Check for different configurator methods that may be available including cloud save and web based quiz.
completeCallback(cloudSaveExists, quizExists, error) expects a boolean expressive if this player has a cloud save and/or if they attempted the web based quiz.
bool PreviousSeasonSaves_DownloadQuiz(currentSeasonName, completeCallback)
Download quiz nodes from the server for player\'s who\'ve played the web experience generating previous season choices.
completeCallback(quizNodes, error) expects a list of strings to be available as quizNodes and possibly an error in case of processing failures.
bool PreviousSeasonSaves_Download(previousSeasonName, progressCallback, completeCallback)
You\'ll need to be logged into a Telltale Account before performing this action or have logged in at some point.
If no previous season saves exist this function does not immediately return an error, the error is available in the completeCallback
Saves are small so the progressCallback may be called very few times. 
The progressCallback will receive three arguments: 
a floating point percentage between 0 and 100, the number of bytes that have been downloaded, and the total number 
of bytes that will be downloaded. Because the percentage is a float, it is recommended that the percentage is truncated to a fixed number 
PreviousSeasonSaves_Cancel: Warning -- The current platform is unable to cancel network API calls.

PurchaseManager.lua
This is responsible for handling all purchase requests.
Overide these for messaging during time intensive purpose opertions:
nil PurchaseManager_ShowMakingPurchaseMessage()
nil PurchaseManager_HideMakingPurchaseMessage()
Overide this to update status of purchase:
nil PurchaseManager_RefreshEpisode()
bool,string PurchaseManager_Purchase( dlc )
Purchases the dlc with the given name. On certain platforms, this may also download the DLC.
DLC names are listed in connectedcontent.prop and the DLC are described in project_connectedcontent.prop.
On Success, returns true. On failure returns nil and an error message/code.
Note that success does not necessarily indicate that a purchase was made.
As a matter of best practices, any error should result in a user facing message. The known error messages are as follows:
: There was a problem retrieving offers from the platform specific servers (e.g. Empty store on PSN). This applies to PS3 [R200]
: The User Manager silo is reporting that the user is not licensed. (Usually this means the user is playing the demo.)
: The user account is not set up to make payments (failed iOS SKPaymentQueue +canMakePayments)
: The user account is underage so we are preventing network access. This applies to PS3 [R040]
: The DLC has already been purchased and cannot be purchased again.
: The purchase system is not supported at all on the current platform.
: The user cancelled a payment request.
: The platform purchase handler encountered an unknown failure.
bool PurchaseManager_RestorePurchases()
Implement the iOS \
 API to recover previous transactions made by the current user.
This functionality must be exposed because, per Apple guidelines, this function (which prompts a store login) should not be called automatically.
bool PurchaseManager_CanMakePayments( )
Checks if payments can be made at this time
On Success, returns true. On failure returns false
bool PurchaseManager_PurchaseIncludesDownload()
Checks if the current platform has integrated purchase+download functionality.
These platforms should use PurchaseManager_Purchase to redownload purchased content rather than a separate download module.
Traditionally, this is the case on dedicated gaming platforms like Xbox and Playstation.
nil PurchaseManager_InstallAndReset()
Installs any finished downloads and then resets the engine. Installing may cause system UI to appear on the screen.
This will always cause the game to reset whether or not anything needs to be installed.
Calls PurchaseManager_RefreshDLC which will update DLC status
Also sets the \'Purchased\' value on success

Rating Manager
RatingManager.lua
This will trigger manage rating reminders on supported platforms

of preset time RatingManager_SetSignificantEvent is called plus uses
nil RatingManager_SetSignificantEvent(showRating)
Will set a significant game event. Pass true if you want it to prompt the user right away if this is enough sig events
A rating message will automatically populate on launch or at the trigger of a significant event

Logs the user into the respective platform and sets status properties
If their is an external wrapper used or any other reason to automatically login, override this and return true:
bool UserManager_AutomaticallyLogIn()
On PC/MAC which doesn\'t have platform login screens, this function should be overridden. It should display
 a login prompt and return if login was a success, .  Use UserManager_TTAuthentication_Validate for validation.
Error handling for incorrect logins needs to be handled as well. 
bool UserManager_TriggerInternalLoginScreen()
Authentication URL: This is the URL for Telltale auth
Authentication Timeout:  seconds till timeout on authentication
bool UserManager_LogIn()
Presents the user with sign in, returns login success.  Most platforms must have a good login to continue. 
Note that this will cache login status, so it won\'t prompt the user unless absolutly needed. This means most of
the time, this function can be called anytime to update the properties without impacting the user experience
bool UserManager_TTAuthentication_ExistValidData()
Checks if their exists valid authentication data internally
Should be used almost exclusivly for implementing UserManager_TriggerInternalLoginScreen
bool UserManager_TTAuthentication_Validate(user,password)
Connects to the server and validates user. User/Password are optional and use cached value if not specified
username,password OpenPasswordBox()
On PC only, will open a password box for username/password entry and return values
(user.prop)
\'Logged In\' - True if the user is signed into the device
\'Save Space Available\' - True if there is available content space to save
\'Can Purchase\' - Tue if a user can make purchases
\'Licensed\' - True if the user is licensed for this product. Demo or not. 
\'TTUser\' - True if the user is a Telltale Account User
\'Name\' - Stores the user name of the player
*** Note, these are particulary not stored as prefs because status should be reset each time the game is launched. 
*** However, they will stay in memory as props because they have been changed
